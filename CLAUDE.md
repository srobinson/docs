# docs

Strategic context hub for all projects. On session start read:

1. `PROJECTS.md` — project descriptions, lineage, current focus, experiment data
2. `MEMORY_PROPOSAL.md` — context efficiency thesis (navigation, not memory; signal-to-noise ratio; fmm+mdcontext convergence)
3. `EXPERIMENT_HARNESS.md` — experiment design for proving fmm value via Nancy logs
